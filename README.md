This repository contains my solutions to the advent of code puzzles available at https://adventofcode.com/

I do not strive for elegance or anything, I just solve a puzzle (often brute forcing it) and if it executes fast enough I move on to the next one.

If the puzzle suits my fancy I implement a [Funge-98](https://github.com/catseye/Funge-98/blob/master/doc/funge98.markdown) solution for fun that I run using my own interpreter [gofunge98](https://git.adyxax.org/adyxax/gofunge98).
